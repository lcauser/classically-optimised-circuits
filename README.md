# Example code for the paper "Scalable simulation of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics via classically optimised unitary circuits"

This paper explains how to optimize brickwall unitary circuits on classical computers to efficiently simulate quantum Hamiltonian dynamics using tensor network techniques. Contained in this repository is three minimal example scripts for a Cluster Ising model, PXP model, and next-nearest-neighbouring Ising model. Each script shows the code used to optimize each of the models, and shows how to calculate the relevent error metrics.
